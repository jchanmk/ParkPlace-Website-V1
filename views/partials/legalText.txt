1. Guest
 
1.1 Space Booking Service
ParkPlace provides Guests access to the information of location and availability of parking spaces and aiding them in securing parking at a location. These locations are private driveways, private garages, and other off-street parking locations for which there is a sole owner. Each individual location may be subject to the Hosts own terms and conditions. Once the vehicle owner requests a booking through the ParkPlace mobile application the Guest has the ability to communicate with the Host (owner of listing) regarding the request. The Host of the spot is an independent third party and is not under ParkPlace’s control and therefore, the terms and conditions surrounding the booking fall to the Host. As a Guest you therefore acknowledge that each spot is not under the control of ParkPlace and that the terms and conditions are determined by the Host of which you agree with upon confirmation of booking by the Host either through the automatic timeframe or by manual confirmation. By using the Space Booking Service, you agree to receive notifications regarding your booking by ParkPlace. Hereby you agree that the ultimate decision of using the parking place upon receiving a confirmation of location and reservation provided to you by ParkPlace falls on you and you alone and any risks associated therewith you have acknowledged as inherent with your usage of the Space Booking Service. ParkPlace does not own and operate any parking locations. Furthermore, ParkPlace assumes no responsibility or liability for any person, vehicle or property at any location.
 
1.2 Price and Service Fee
The price that you the Guest see is set by the Host of the spot and with the additional service fee included. Price at a location may change depending on the Host, however ParkPlace will always charge a 20% fee to the Guest. The service fee will be displayed before confirming your booking and on your receipt. Price changes will not affect previous bookings already accepted by both the Guest and the Host. With this being said ParkPlace does not guarantee that the price you, the Guest, pays is the appropriate price at the time of your booking request. All charges are non-refundable unless stated by ParkPlace. You may be eligible to receive a coupon upon completion or incompletion of a booking due to any complication or if the request is deemed reasonable by ParkPlace. These are only valid for use on the ParkPlace platform and can not be converted in to a deposit to a registered bank account. 
 
1.3 Privacy Policy
We are committed to protecting your privacy online. The information you provide we request to be accurate for your own safety and we request each user review’s ParkPlace Privacy Policy for a description of what information is being collected and the use of it in ParkPlace’s service. 
 
1.4 Damage and Disputes between Users
Upon confirmation of a booking between you, the Guest, and a Host, you have accepted that you are entering the property at your own discretion. You are therefore responsible for leaving the property in the condition that you found it. ParkPlace is not responsible for any damage to you or the property while you are engaged in a booking with a Host and does not guarantee the security of your vehicle and its contents. You as a Guest are responsible for any individuals you bring to the property and their acts and behavior during the booking. If your vehicle or you personally experience any form of damage during your booking on the Host’s property, you agree to as a primary option resolve the matter with your host and insurance company. If the matter cannot be resolved through communication with the Host and ParkPlace deems the request reasonable then ParkPlace will conduct a mediation meeting to resolve the matter for both parties under the supervision of ParkPlace or an appointed third-party. If your vehicle is stolen please contact the police and your insurance provider immediately, ParkPlace assumes no insurance coverage for any User. 

2. Host
 
2.1 Ownership and Right to Rent Property
By listing a parking spot for rent on the ParkPlace application, you are confirming that the address information and proof of ownership as well as ability to rent out the spot is accurate and compliant with local laws. It is your responsibility to be aware of and abide to local laws in connection to the renting out of your property. ParkPlace is not responsible for any consequences of your failed awareness to the local laws, regulation and policies. To verify ownership, ParkPlace requires an image showing a proof of address, most commonly a utility bill or any other formal property ownership declaration showing both the User’s name and address when listing a spot. If you are a tenant of the property, we may require a confirmation of consent to rent the spot from the landlord as an additional measure to rent the property.  
 
2.2 Taxation
ParkPlace may require collecting appropriate tax information from Hosts. As a Host you understand that any appropriate governmental agency and/or authority, hereto referred to as the Tax Authority, where your spot is located may require taxes to be collected and remitted to the Tax Authority. The laws may vary, but these taxes may be required to be collected and remitted as a percentage of the agreed price between Guest and Host per transaction or per day, or any other variation and are sometimes called “occupancy taxes” and other variations.
 
We require all Hosts to report the income earned by using the ParkPlace service to the local Tax Authority.
 
2.3 Guidelines
By you agreeing to the ParkPlace Terms and Conditions you are entering an exclusive agreement for your spots, while they are considered “Live” on the application. As a Host you agree not to contact Guests for a parking agreement outside of the ParkPlace service application and not to provide any other goods & services through the ParkPlace application to Guests. You agree not to solicit with other Hosts in the area and form any alliances to undercut homeowner prices. 

2.4 Damage to Host Property
By agreeing to these Terms and Conditions you acknowledge that you are voluntarily entering into a booking agreement with a Guest and granting them permission to enter your property. Where possible ParkPlace will aid to resolve any of the issues that arise during a booking agreement on your property. By agreeing to these terms, you agree that ParkPlace is not responsible for any damage to your property or person that may occur during an agreement between Users. ParkPlace does not guarantee any safety of the property and you are responsible for ensuring that your property is adequately secured and protected when entering an agreement. In the result of any damage occurring you agree to attempt to resolve the matter through direct contact with the User. If you and the User are unable to resolve the issue through direct contact than you may contact ParkPlace to pursue a formal resolution process. ParkPlace does not provide insurance coverage to the Host and you as the licensed operator or owner of the property are required to obtain the insurance coverage necessary to rent out your spot.

In addition, to being removed you agree to burden of the costs incurred by the Host (such as the towing agency or legal entity called into action). Furthermore, ParkPlace reserves the right to charge you for any bookings that were intended occur after your own booking and were either delayed or canceled at a rate higher than what was originally paid.
